 spec_sram.v (orion_sram.v of karabas-go-core-orion128, msx_sram.v of karabas-go-core-msx before it)

 The SRAM of the board (two byte lanes of 2M x 8, 10 ns, asynchronous) as one byte port of the
 machine: a byte address of 22 bits (MA = addr[21:1], the lane by addr[0]: MWR_N[0] / MD[7:0] for
 even bytes, as the NES core has it). /OE (MRD_N) is tied low by the top.

 Slots of two clocks (clk 40 MHz: one clock, 25 ns, is less than the address out, tAA and
 the data in; two are 50 ns, TS_SRAM_OUT / TS_SRAM_IN of the ucf bound the pads):
 - the first edge of a slot takes the address (and a pending write) into the address registers;
 - a read slot takes MD at the first edge of the next slot (two clocks after the address), dout
   is the byte of its lane one clock later;
 - a write slot pulls /WE low and drives MD from the falling edge of its first clock to the
   falling edge of its second clock, so the address is stable half a clock before and after /WE.
 The SRAM is read all the time at addr: dout follows a change of addr within seven clocks (the
 port goes through a register first), which is far less than the access of the CPU (an M1 read of the Z80 at 3.58 MHz
 takes the data two T-states, 24 clocks, after the address). The machine and the loaders hold
 addr while they read.

 karabas: wr16 writes both lanes of the word at addr[21:1], {din_hi, din}: a write to the screen
 stores its points and their colour in one slot (spec_system).

 we is a level or a pulse: the rising edge requests one write of din at addr (taken at that
 edge; both must hold until then). A write waits for the next slot, at most two clocks; the
 writers here write once in 10 clocks or less often (the loaders of the mcu, the Z80).

 The aux port (the disk image cache, the loaders, later the disk cache): aux_req held with aux_addr / aux_we /
 aux_din until aux_ack (one clock; with a read aux_dout is the byte then). The slots alternate
 between the machine and the aux port; a slot of the aux port without a request is the
 machine's. With requests all the time, the machine has every other slot: its reads take up to
 nine clocks, under a T-state of the Z80 (12); a request of the aux port takes four to six.

 The video port: a pulse of vid_req with vid_addr (a word address, one per 16 clocks at most) takes
 the next slot before everything else. vid_valid is a clock with the 16 bits in vid_dout, 6 clocks
 after the request at the latest.
